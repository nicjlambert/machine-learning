# Definition

“The field of machine learning is concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that automatically improve with experience.”^[Mitchell, T. (1997). Machine Learning. McGraw Hill.]

# Origin

Computer Science:
* how to manually program computers to solve tasks

Statistics:
* what conclusions can be inferred from data

Machine Learning:
* intersection of computer science and statistics
* how to get computers to program themselves from experience plus some initial structure
* effective data capture, store, index, retrieve and merge
* computational tractability^[Mitchell, T.M., 2006. The discipline of machine learning (Vol. 9). Pittsburgh, PA: Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science, Machine Learning Department.]

# Types of machine learning
Machine learning approaches are divided into two main types

* **Supervised**
    * training of a “predictive” model from data
    * one (or more) attribute of the dataset is used to “predict” another attribute e.g., classification

* **Unsupervised**
    * discovery of descriptive patterns in data
    * commonly used in data mining e.g., clustering
    
# Supervised

* Training dataset
    * input attribute(s)
    * attribute to predict

* Testing dataset
    * input attribute(s)
    * attribute to predict

* Type of learning model
* Evaluation function
    * evaluates difference between prediction and output in testing data
    
# Unsupervised

* Dataset
    * input attribute(s) to explore

* Type of model for the learning process
    * most approaches are iterative 
    * e.g., hierarchical clustering

* Evaluation function
    * evaluates the quality of the pattern under consideration during one iteration

# Semi-supervised learning

Supervised learning requires “labelled data”

 * which can be expensive to acquire

Semi-supervised learning

* combines a small amount of labelled data with a larger un-labelled dataset
    * train on small labelled dataset
    * apply model to larger unlabled dataset generating “pseudo-labels”
    * re-train the model with all data (including “pseudo-labels”)
    * assumptions: continuity, cluster, and manifold (lower dimensionality)
    
# Reinforcement learning

Based on the idea of training agents to learn how to

* take actions
    * which affect: agent state, environment
* to maximize reward
* balancing:
    * exploration (new paths/options)
    * exploitation (of current knowledge)
    
# Overfitting

* creating a model
perfect for the training data
but not generic enough
to be useful for prediction

* An issue for machine learning
e.g., regression
n predictors can generate a line fitting the data exactly n cases
Occam’s razor
one in ten rule
10 cases per predictor

# Algorithmic bias

Assumptions and training dataset quality still matter!

* garbage in, garbage out
